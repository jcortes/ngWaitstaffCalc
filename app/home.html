        <p>This is a tool that helps wait staff at restaurants compute meal costs and track their tips</p>

        <p><strong>Meal Details: </strong>
            The user enters the base cost for a meal, the tax rate, and the tip percentage 
            the customer wants to leave. When they hit the submit button, the app should validate 
            that the value in each field is numeric. If the form is valid, the Customer Charges 
            and My Earnings Info section should update accordingly.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Customer Charges: </strong>
            This panel displays what the customer should be charged. Subtotal is the value of the 
            base meal price plus tax. Tip is dollar value of the tip, given the subtotal and tip 
            percentage. Total is equal to subtotal plus tip.
        </p>

        <p><strong>My Earnings Info: </strong>
            This panel displays cumulative information about all of the meals submitted so far. 
            Tip total is the sum of all tips computed so far. Meal count is the total number of meals 
            input into the tool. Average tip per meal is equal to the total tip value divided by 
            the number of meals.
